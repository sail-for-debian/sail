Sail is a language for expressing the instruction-set
architecture (ISA) semantics of processors.

Vendor architecture specification documents typically describe the
sequential behaviour of their ISA with a combination of prose, tables,
and pseudocode for each instruction.

They vary in how precise that pseudocode is: in some it is just
suggestive, while in others it is close to a complete description of
the envelope of architecturally allowed behaviour for sequential code.

For x86{blank}cite:[Intel61], the Intel pseudocode is just suggestive,
with embedded prose, while the AMD descriptions{blank}cite:[AMD_3_21]
are prose alone. For IBM Power{blank}cite:[Power3.0B], there is
detailed pseudocode which has recently become
machine-processed{blank}cite:[Leighton21]. For
Arm{blank}cite:[armarmv8], there is detailed pseudocode, which has
recently become machine-processed{blank}cite:[Reid16]. For
MIPS{blank}cite:[MIPS64-II,MIPS64-III] there is also reasonably detailed
pseudocode.

Sail is intended:

* To support precise definition of real-world ISA semantics;

* To be accessible to engineers familiar with existing vendor
  pseudocodes, with a similar style to the pseudocodes used by ARM and
  IBM Power (modulo minor syntactic differences);

* To expose the structure needed to combine the sequential ISA
  semantics with the relaxed-memory concurrency models we have
  developed;
  
* To provide an expressive type system that can statically check the
  bitvector length and indexing computation that arises in these
  specifications, to detect errors and to support code generation,
  with type inference to minimise the required type annotations;

* To support execution, for architecturally complete emulation
  automatically based on the definition;

* To support automatic generation of theorem-prover definitions, for
  mechanised reasoning about ISA specifications; and

* To be as minimal as possible given the above, to ease the tasks of
  code generation and theorem-prover definition generation.

A Sail specification will typically define an abstract syntax type/tre
(AST) of machine instructions, a decode function that takes binary
values to AST values, and an execute function that describes how each
of those behaves at runtime, together with whatever auxiliary
functions and types are needed.

Given such a specification, the Sail implementation can typecheck it
and generate:

* An internal representation of the fully type-annotated
  definition (a deep embedding of the definition) in a form that can
  be executed by the Sail interpreter.  These are both expressed in
  Lem{blank}cite:[Lem-icfp2014,Lemcode], a language of type, function, and
  relation definitions that can be compiled into OCaml and various
  theorem provers. The Sail interpreter can also be used to analyse
  instruction definitions (or partially executed instructions) to
  determine their potential register and memory footprints.

* A shallow embedding of the definition, also in Lem, that can be
  executed or converted to theorem-prover code more directly.
  Currently this is aimed at Isabelle/HOL or HOL4, though the Sail
  dependent types should support generation of idiomatic Coq definitions
  (directly rather than via Lem).

* A compiled version of the specification
  directly into OCaml.

* A more efficient executable version of the specification, compiled
  into C code.

Sail has been used to develop models of parts of several architectures:

The Arm-v8 (ASL) model is based on an automatic translation of Arm's
machine-readable public v8.3 ASL specification footnote:[ARM v8-A
  Architecture Specification: https://github.com/meriac/archex]. It includes everything in
ARM's specification.

The MIPS model is hand-written based on the MIPS64 manual version
2.5{blank}cite:[MIPS64-II,MIPS64-III],
but covering only the features in the BERI hardware
reference{blank}cite:[UCAM-CL-TR-868],
which in turn drew on MIPS4000 and MIPS32{blank}cite:[MIPS4000,MIPS32-I].

The CHERI model is based on that and the CHERI ISA reference manual
version{nbsp}5{blank}cite:[UCAM-CL-TR-891]. These two are both
principally by Norton-Wright; they cover all basic user
and kernel mode MIPS features sufficient to boot FreeBSD, including a
TLB, exceptions and a basic UART for console interaction. ISA
extensions such as floating point are not covered. The CHERI model
supports either 256-bit capabilities or 128-bit compressed
capabilities.
